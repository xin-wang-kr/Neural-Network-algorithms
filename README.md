# Neural-Network-algorithms
This is my algorithm practice based on the book [**Foundamentals of Neural Networks: Architectures, Algorithms, and Applications**](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Neural-Networks-Architectures-Applications/dp/0133341860)
I wrote the python codes for the neural networks below:
 * Backpropagation Neural Network:
   - Applied different architectures (input layer, hidden layer, and output layer) and different activation functions (bipolar sigmoid and binary sigmoid functions).
   - Performed backpropagation neural network for classification and prediction task separately. 
 * Pattern Association:
   - Applied autoassociative Hopfield network for pattern recognition task.
   - Applied bidirectional associative memory (BAM) for pattern recognition task.
 * Competitive-Learning-Algorithm
   - Applied self-organizing maps to visualize high-dimenstional data into two-dimentional space.
   - Applied learning vector quantization (LVQ) for classification task.
